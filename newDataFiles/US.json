Performing with the original music arrangements, Halston and his world-class band bring the Sinatra sound and swagger to the stage with a swanky Vegas vibe. Dave's performance is so outstanding, he was chosen by Barbara Sinatra, Frank's widow, to perform for her birthday party. She called his performance \"WONDERFUL!\" - MORE RAVE REVIEWS!? \"I've seen a half dozen Sinatra singer wannabes. This guy smokes 'em all!\"? \"We saw his show last year and we're coming to see him again. It's that good!\"? \"Finally, a performer who can do the Sinatra songbook justice!\"? \"The voice and phrasing are spot-on.

DiscoShow celebrates the music and a movement which ignited a decade. The inferno is still burning, burning - and you are a VIP guest. Just ask for Mother. DiscoShow is inspired by the spirit of David Mancuso's legendary New York City loft parties at 99 Prince Street; a psychedelic extension of the childhood parties the nuns used to throw at his orphanage. While New York faced its toughest times, and President Ford told the city to 'drop dead', Mancuso and his friends simply said, 'let's dance'. The DJ stood at the altar, and salvation was found on the dance floor. Disco was born. DiscoShow is unlike any other show in the world. Once you make it past Mother's velvet rope, guests will be in the room with the characters who were there at the height of disco. You can be a bystander and just watch. Or you can lose yourself in the music, and maybe even find yourself.","category":"performing-arts","start":"2024-10-05T04:30:00Z","geo":{"geometry":{"coordinates":[-115.1726395,36.1180682],"type":"Point"},"placekey":"225-246@5yv-j88-tsq","address":{"country_code":"US","formatted_address":"3535 Las Vegas Blvd S, Las Vegas, NV 89109, USA","postcode":"89109","locality":"Las Vegas","region":"Nevada"}},"labels":["entertainment","performing-arts"],"duration":0,"start_local":"2024-10-04T21:30:00","end":"2024-10-05T04:30:00Z","end_local":"2024-10-04T21:30:00","updated":"2024-07-05T08:58:57Z"},{"title":"Atomic Saloon Show","description":"Sourced from predicthq.com","category":"performing-arts","start":"2024-10-05T04:30:00Z","geo":{"geometry":{"coordinates":[-115.1674242,36.1223898],"type":"Point"},"placekey":"22c-246@5yv-j89-btv","address":{"country_code":"US","formatted_address":"3377 Las Vegas Blvd S Suite 2600, Las Vegas, NV 89109, USA","postcode":"89109","locality":"Las Vegas","region":"Nevada"}},"labels":["entertainment","performing-arts"],"duration":0,"start_local":"2024-10-04T21:30:00","end":"2024-10-05T04:30:00Z","end_local":"2024-10-04T21:30:00","updated":"2024-06-11T00:16:22Z"},{"title":"Jessimae Peluso","description":"Sourced from predicthq.com","category":"concerts","start":"2024-10-05T04:30:00Z","geo":{"geometry":{"coordinates":[-117.273316,32.8405],"type":"Point"},"placekey":"22c-222@5z5-pmv-rx5","address":{"country_code":"US","formatted_address":"916 Pearl St, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA","postcode":"92037","locality":"San Diego","region":"California"}},"labels":["concert","music"],"duration":0,"start_local":"2024-10-04T21:30:00","end":"2024-10-05T04:30:00Z","end_local":"2024-10-04T21:30:00","updated":"2024-07-07T13:20:15Z"},{"title":"Cirque du Soleil : \"O\"","description":"Sourced from predicthq.com - Cirque du Soleil paints an aquatic masterpiece of surrealism and theatrical romance in the timeless production, \"O\".

King Tut's Tomb","description":"Sourced from predicthq.com - A century ago, Howard Carter made the greatest archeological discovery of all time when he uncovered the lost tomb of Tutankhamun and its magnificent treasure trove. Celebrate this amazing find by exploring the immersive exhibition Discovering King Tuts Tomb, now open at Luxor. Follow in Carters footsteps, peer through the wall of the antechamber, unlock the burial room, and come face-to-face with the mummy. Behold the artistry of the nested coffins and view Tuts notorious death mask. Discover why the Egyptians used mummification as a way to preserve and honor their pharaoh leader. Enter a world that sparkles with gold and learn what the treasures themselves reveal about the boy king and ancient Egyptian culture. With the audio guide, guests can transport themselves back in time by hearing Howards own retelling of the moment he first set foot inside the tomb. Light your torch, break the seal, defy the mummys curse and enter if you dare.","category":"expos","start":"2024-10-05T02:00:00Z","geo":{"geometry":{"coordinates":[-115.1760672,36.09551],"type":"Point"},"placekey":"0tb3bit3st@5yv-j89-p5f","address":{"country_code":"US","formatted_address":"South

The original production starred the unparalleled Sutton Foster, who received Tony, Outer Critics Circle and Drama Desk nominations for her performance. Based on Louisa May Alcott's life, Little Women follows the adventures of sisters, Jo, Meg, Beth and Amy March. Jo is trying to sell her stories for publication, but the publishers are not interested - her friend, Professor Bhaer, tells her that she has to do better and write more from herself. Begrudgingly taking this advice, Jo weaves the story of herself and her sisters and their experience growing up in Civil War America.

DiscoShow celebrates the music and a movement which ignited a decade. The inferno is still burning, burning - and you are a VIP guest. Just ask for Mother. DiscoShow is inspired by the spirit of David Mancuso's legendary New York City loft parties at 99 Prince Street; a psychedelic extension of the childhood parties the nuns used to throw at his orphanage. While New York faced its toughest times, and President Ford told the city to 'drop dead', Mancuso and his friends simply said, 'let's dance'. The DJ stood at the altar, and salvation was found on the dance floor. Disco was born. DiscoShow is unlike any other show in the world. Once you make it past Mother's velvet rope, guests will be in the room with the characters who were there at the height of disco. You can be a bystander and just watch.
