After intermission the orchestra will play Khachaturian's Masquerade Suite, five gorgeous sections from his folkloric ballet suite, each a beautiful dance with a different character: a Waltz, a Nocturne with a haunting solo violin line, a Mazurka, a Romance and a final Galop performed at an amazing speed.","category":"concerts","start":"2024-09-29T00:00:00Z","geo":{"geometry":{"coordinates":[-79.4141305,43.7662845],"type":"Point"},"placekey":"1cufwpf537@665-z8k-pgk","address":{"country_code":"CA","formatted_address":"5040 Yonge Street\nToronto, ON M2N 6R8\nCanada","postcode":"M2N 6R8","locality":"Toronto","region":"Ontario"}},"labels":["concert","music"],"duration":0,"start_local":"2024-09-28T20:00:00","end":"2024-09-29T00:00:00Z","end_local":"2024-09-28T20:00:00","updated":"2024-06-11T09:04:18Z"},{"title":"Bye Parula and Impresaria","description":"Sourced from predicthq.com","category":"concerts","start":"2024-09-29T00:00:00Z","geo":{"geometry":{"coordinates":[-71.2401091,46.7579296],"type":"Point"},"placekey":"1sv4hf6inh@66b-mdg-jy9","address":{"country_code":"CA","formatted_address":"2172 Chem. du Fleuve, Lévis, QC G6W 1Y6, Canada","postcode":"G6W 1Y6","locality":"Lévis","region":"Québec"}},"labels":["concert","music"],"duration":0,"start_local":"2024-09-28T20:00:00","end":"2024-09-29T00:00:00Z","end_local":"2024-09-28T20:00:00","updated":"2024-06-11T08:38:15Z"},{"title":"Jorane","description":"Sourced from predicthq.com","category":"concerts","start":"2024-09-29T00:00:00Z","geo":{"geometry":{"coordinates":[-73.5671546,45.5087317],"type":"Point"},"placekey":"@66b-2g5-bx5","address":{"country_code":"CA","formatted_address":"Montreal, QC H2X 1Y9, Canada","postcode":"H2X 1Y9","locality":"Montreal","region":"Quebec"}},"labels":["concert","music"],"duration":0,"start_local":"2024-09-28T20:00:00","end":"2024-09-29T00:00:00Z","end_local":"2024-09-28T20:00:00","updated":"2024-06-28T21:31:52Z"},{"title":"Avenue 54 Disco Show","description":"Sourced from predicthq.com","category":"community","start":"2024-09-29T00:00:00Z","geo":{"geometry":{"coordinates":[-73.525995,45.504609],"type":"Point"},"placekey":"1rprffgjyh@66b-2fz-wc5","address":{"country_code":"CA","formatted_address":"Québec Pavilion, 1 Ave du Casino, Montréal, QC H3C 4W7, Canada","postcode":"H3C 4W7","locality":"Montréal","region":"Québec"}},"labels":["concert","music"],"duration":0,"start_local":"2024-09-28T20:00:00","end":"2024-09-29T00:00:00Z","end_local":"2024-09-28T20:00:00","updated":"2024-06-04T04:14:12Z"},{"title":"Alfa Rococo","description":"Sourced from predicthq.com","category":"concerts","start":"2024-09-29T00:00:00Z","geo":{"geometry":{"coordinates":[-72.51087,45.21637],"type":"Point"},"placekey":"@66b-5c8-5vf","address":{"country_code":"CA","formatted_address":"9 Chem. du Mont-Écho, Knowlton, QC J0E 1V0, Canada","postcode":"J0E 1V0","locality":"Knowlton","region":"Québec"}},"labels":["concert","music"],"duration":0,"start_local":"2024-09-28T20:00:00","end":"2024-09-29T00:00:00Z","end_local":"2024-09-28T20:00:00","updated":"2024-06-27T21:35:36Z"},{"title":"The Wobbly Pops","description":"Sourced from predicthq.com","category":"concerts","start":"2024-09-29T00:00:00Z","geo":{"geometry":{"coordinates":[-81.2467422,42.9813232],"type":"Point"},"placekey":"@63v-jv8-xt9","address":{"country_code":"CA","formatted_address":"York Street, London, ON N6A 1B1, Canada","locality":"London","postcode":"N6A 1B1","region":"Ontario"}},"labels":["concert","music"],"duration":0,"start_local":"2024-09-28T20:00:00","end":"2024-09-29T00:00:00Z","end_local":"2024-09-28T20:00:00","updated":"2024-06-11T01:27:20Z"},{"title":"An Evening With The Fab Four","description":"Sourced from predicthq.com","category":"concerts","start":"2024-09-29T00:00:00Z","geo":{"geometry":{"coordinates":[-79.6439,43.5872],"type":"Point"},"placekey":"1wjzxb4b2m@665-zky-d7q","address":{"country_code":"CA","formatted_address":"4141 Living Arts Drive, Mississauga, L5B 4B8, Canada","postcode":"L5B 4B8","locality":"Mississauga"}},"labels":["concert","music"],"duration":0,"start_local":"2024-09-28T20:00:00","end":"2024-09-29T00:00:00Z","end_local":"2024-09-28T20:00:00","updated":"2024-07-05T12:37:46Z"},{"title":"Somos Flamenco","description":"Sourced from predicthq.com -

Required)ABOUT THE SHOWDivine Brown is an evolution of sound. She is acrobatic in melody with her five octave range, unlimited by phrase or stanza. She is a Canadian vocal treasure who also boasts acting chops to complement her soulster prowess. A Juno award winning recording artist, she has navigated the music industry on her terms. Such is her talent, that Broadway should have afforded her a permanent stage, but she chose to become a recording artist. As such she is not confined to the ROld Skool Love, rather pushes boundaries releasing dance tracks and remixes, then switches lanes to captivate audiences with the subtleties and nuances that imbibe the music that is Jazz. Billy, Sarah & Ella: Revolutionary Women in Jazz, gives Divine the platform not only to showcase her powerhouse vocal gift, but gives her resonance of experience with the ladies she is privileged to present. Each profoundly talented, each faced decades of challenges beyond the stage, beyond their creativity.

OUTRIDER is a traditional Zeppelin-esche 4 piece, guitar-based rock band. An OUTRIDER concert features intense guitar and high-flying vocals backed up by the driving groove of bass and drums. Complimented by a few street-level originals, the bands re-workings of popular rock staples provide audiences with an energizing balance of familiar songs to sing along to, air guitar over, or dance to. This is counter-balanced by a handful of beloved rock ballads. Throughout their full concert set, OUTRIDER will be joined on stage by some very special guest musicians. This exciting party-concert event will also be a celebration of lead singers (Tim Huffs) 60th birthday! While it is a FREE-ticketed event, there will additionally be fun and meaningful on-site opportunities to support the significant work of Youth Unlimited. Tim Huff is a career staffer with YU.
