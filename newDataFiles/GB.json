Gary Meikle is back yet again with another self-written, self-deprecating show to leave you all short of breath again. Last year “Papa” as he is becoming more commonly known as, because the 1st ever comedian worldwide without an agent (his choice) to be granted a full working visa for the USA and is keen to keep on showing why. Gary’s tour this year promises to deliver, he will reluctantly share his newer role in life being a kept man, by the lady that kept him of course being his ever-growing smarter granddaughter, Gracie. Who intelligently but more essentially rips the piss out of her Papa daily. A few stories to note are when she blatantly points out that he’s got “moobs”. She also embarrasses him by telling the truth about his tattoos to a stranger that he is trying to impress. She explains in detail how her Papa isn’t THAT famous and how she calls him a bad name without meaning it. There are literally to many Gracie and Papa stories to cover but as usual Gary will go of on tangents and delve into the workings of his on mind. He will tackle subjects such as: rejection issues of men and women, what it was like being a 14-year-old hormonal boy, how it is ok for men to be overtly feminine now, cold showers, mosquitoes on holiday and much more. If you can guarantee one thing from Gary it is that he will work, his 5’8 ass off to make sure everyone that sees him live wants to come back for more. Your laughter makes up for the rejection he suffered in his earlier years, and he will thank you all individually if you choose to come along to his meet and greet, pre-show that he will be doing at every single show again. Love, Gary X \n\n \nAccessible Info \nThere is a lift up to the first floor and a ramp into the studio.

grab your tickets now as they tend to go quickly - it's tables and chairs and plenty of room for partying!\n\nJoin Sax legend Leo Green and his incredible band and singers for an amazing, fun, high energy night featuring classics from the last 30 years or so - rearranged and drenched in Leo's inimitable Sax! \n\nOver the last couple of years, this show has built a reputation as one of the most fun and entertaining shows around:\n\n\"We were blown away with the show!\" .......“I couldn’t sit still!”  .........“I loved it, I had the best time EVER!”   .....“The vibes were amazing”\n\nCheck out Leo and his show on his Social Channels: Instagram or TikTok or Facebook or YouTube\n\n\nSax legend Leo Green’s musical prowess has taken him all over the world as saxophonist for everyone from Jack Savoretti to Paul McCartney. Not to mention rock'n'roll icon Jerry Lee Lewis, who once declared him to be “The greatest sax player I have ever worked with.” \n\nLeo has channelled his talents – together with his little black book of extraordinary contacts – into his exciting stage show, which has become one of London's 'must see' shows.\n\nLeo's shows will play host to an array of ultra-talented musicians and singers - who have worked with everyone from Rita Ora to Aretha Franklin - as they put their own unique jazzy, bluesy, funky and soulful twist on some of the best loved songs of the last 30 or so years.\n\nEverything is woven together by Leo’s inimitable hosting and his trusty sax. Says Leo, “As with all my shows, it's the songs that are the stars; these are the soundtracks that people love to hear and relate to. Bringing the classics to life offers the perfect combination. After all, what could be better than watching, listening and of course SUGGESTING SONGS -  to a band and singers perform with a slice of jazzy soulful Sax, whilst losing yourself in a classic London Club?
