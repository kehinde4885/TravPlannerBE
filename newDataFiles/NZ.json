Giuseppe Verdi's opera, a smash hit since its debut, is brimming with crowd-pleasing melodies and lush orchestrations. 'La donna e mobile' is the hit but the composer preferred 'Bella figlia dell'amore', a sensuous depiction of the characters' motives. \"I never expect to do better,\" Verdi said. The jester finds it less funny when he's cursed by a humiliated parent, and the duke meets Gilda, Rigoletto's beautiful daughter.

Giuseppe Verdi's opera, a smash hit since its debut, is brimming with crowd-pleasing melodies and lush orchestrations. 'La donna e mobile' is the hit but the composer preferred 'Bella figlia dell'amore', a sensuous depiction of the characters' motives. \"I never expect to do better,\" Verdi said. The jester finds it less funny when he's cursed by a humiliated parent, and the duke meets Gilda, Rigoletto's beautiful daughter.

Salina Fisher's Kintsugi was inspired by the Japanese tradition of mending broken pottery with golden seams of lacquer - a fine metaphor for \"embracing 'brokenness' and imperfection.\" American composer Adam Schoenberg was inspired by both the climate catastrophe threatening our natural world and the ancient use of percussion in storytelling.

Giuseppe Verdi's opera, a smash hit since its debut, is brimming with crowd-pleasing melodies and lush orchestrations. 'La donna e mobile' is the hit but the composer preferred 'Bella figlia dell'amore', a sensuous depiction of the characters' motives. \"I never expect to do better,\" Verdi said. The jester finds it less funny when he's cursed by a humiliated parent, and the duke meets Gilda, Rigoletto's beautiful daughter.

It draws from varied sources, including the Book of Genesis, the Biblical book of Psalms, and John Milton's Paradise Lost. Beginning with a musical \"Chaos\", The Creation then depicts each of the 7 days of the bible's creation narrative. These start with a stupendous celebration of the primal light, then the Earth itself and the heavenly bodies. Next, back on Earth, it shows the growth of oceans, global weather, and plant life.

The result, however, is one of the most famous choral works around the world, with passages of fearful angst and resolute acceptance. Mozart was anxious to please the Parisians with his Symphony No. 31 (subsequently named 'Paris'). Although rehearsals went badly, after the performance, Mozart commented: \"I was so happy that as soon as the symphony was over, I went off to Palais Royal, where I had a large ice, and said the Rosary as I had vowed to do.\" Umberto Clerici, Queensland Symphony Orchestra's Chief Conductor, has a flourishing career in Australia and NZ.

Choreographed for an ensemble of twelve uniquely gifted dancers at the height of their powers, and set to a slowly drifting, soulful score by Max Richter, Infra is a profoundly moving meditation on the loneliness, connections and consolations that lie beneath the teeming surface of the city. Julian Opie's mesmerising LED artwork echoes the constant movement of the dancers below as a steady stream of anonymous figures walk purposefully towards destinations that are forever unknown.","category":"performing-arts","start":"2024-08-03T07:30:00Z","geo":{"geometry":{"coordinates":[174.7798564,-41.2933108],"type":"Point"},"placekey":"@n7q-mht-435","address":{"country_code":"NZ","formatted_address":"87/77 Courtenay Place, Te Aro, Wellington 6011, New Zealand","postcode":"6011","locality":"Wellington","region":"Wellington"}},"labels":["entertainment","performing-arts"],"duration":0,"start_local":"2024-08-03T19:30:00","end":"2024-08-03T07:30:00Z","end_local":"2024-08-03T19:30:00","updated":"2024-07-06T06:04:22Z"},{"title":"National League - Northern League - Bay Olympic vs Auckland City","description":"Sourced from predicthq.com","category":"sports","start":"2024-08-03T07:30:00Z","geo":{"geometry":{"coordinates":[174.6913832,-36.9086177],"type":"Point"},"placekey":"@n84-dpt-dvz","address":{"country_code":"NZ","formatted_address":"Olympic Park Portage Road, New Lynn, Auckland 0600, New Zealand","postcode":"0600","locality":"Auckland","region":"Auckland"}},"labels":["soccer","sport"],"duration":0,"start_local":"2024-08-03T19:30:00","end":"2024-08-03T07:30:00Z","end_local":"2024-08-03T19:30:00","updated":"2024-06-11T02:11:40Z"},{"title":"Celeste Barber - Backup Dancer","description":"Sourced from predicthq.com - All Tickets are Mobile Ticket Only.

The Adagio of Bruckner's String Quintet was lauded as \"the pearl of the quintet […] one of the noblest, most enlightened, tenderest and most beautiful in sound.\" Tchaikovsky's Andante cantabile is similarly a movement from a string chamber work, which Tchaikovsky arranged for cello and string orchestra.","category":"performing-arts","start":"2024-05-30T07:30:00Z","geo":{"geometry":{"coordinates":[174.777852,-41.28958],"type":"Point"},"placekey":"@n7q-mht-5xq","address":{"country_code":"NZ","formatted_address":"111 Wakefield Street, Te Aro, Wellington 6011, New Zealand","postcode":"6011","locality":"Wellington","region":"Wellington"}},"labels":["digital","entertainment","music","performing-arts"],"duration":0,"start_local":"2024-05-30T19:30:00","end":"2024-05-30T07:30:00Z","end_local":"2024-05-30T19:30:00","updated":"2024-06-13T11:36:13Z"},{"title":"Reb Fountain, Voom, and Vera Ellen","description":"Sourced from predicthq.com","category":"concerts","start":"2024-05-30T07:00:00Z","geo":{"geometry":{"coordinates":[172.635883,-43.5268798],"type":"Point"},"placekey":"@r3q-vyr-djv","address":{"country_code":"NZ","formatted_address":"86 Kilmore Street, Christchurch Central City, Christchurch 8013, New Zealand","postcode":"8013","locality":"Christchurch","region":"Canterbury"}},"labels":["concert","music"],"duration":0,"start_local":"2024-05-30T19:00:00","end":"2024-05-30T07:00:00Z","end_local":"2024-05-30T19:00:00","updated":"2024-06-13T15:51:25Z"},{"title":"Willie McArthur - Live at The Turf","description":"Sourced from predicthq.com","category":"concerts","start":"2024-05-30T07:00:00Z","geo":{"geometry":{"coordinates":[172.69849,-43.48117],"type":"Point"},"placekey":"@r3q-vzt-d7q","address":{"country_code":"NZ","formatted_address":"Inwoods Road, Christchurch 8083, New Zealand","locality":"Christchurch","postcode":"8083","region":"Canterbury"}},"labels":["concert","music"],"duration":0,"start_local":"2024-05-30T19:00:00","end":"2024-05-30T07:00:00Z","end_local":"2024-05-30T19:00:00","updated":"2024-05-30T19:49:38Z"},{"title":"Jazz Night 2024","description":"Sourced from predicthq.com - A show case of all things Jazz from Cashmere High School, with Combos and Big Bands!","category":"concerts","start":"2024-05-30T07:00:00Z","geo":{"geometry":{"coordinates":[172.6243081,-43.5654702],"type":"Point"},"placekey":"@r3q-w2y-5zz","address":{"country_code":"NZ","formatted_address":"Rose Street, Christchurch 8024, New Zealand","locality":"Christchurch","postcode":"8024","region":"Canterbury"}},"labels":["concert","music"],"duration":9000,"start_local":"2024-05-30T19:00:00","end":"2024-05-30T09:30:00Z","end_local":"2024-05-30T21:30:00","updated":"2024-05-23T05:04:05Z"},{"title":"Travial Pursuit Club Fundraiser","description":"Sourced from predicthq.com","category":"community","start":"2024-05-30T06:30:00Z","geo":{"geometry":{"coordinates":[172.61099,-43.52601],"type":"Point"},"placekey":"@r3q-vzg-7dv","address":{"country_code":"NZ","formatted_address":"Deans Avenue, Christchurch 8011, New Zealand","locality":"Christchurch","postcode":"8011","region":"Canterbury"}},"labels":["community"],"duration":9900,"start_local":"2024-05-30T18:30:00","end":"2024-05-30T09:15:00Z","end_local":"2024-05-30T21:15:00","updated":"2024-05-30T19:01:39Z"},{"title":"Design Lives HERE","description":"Sourced from predicthq.com - 4 speakers, 2 objects + their stories.

The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a joyous comedy about taking risks, finding love and embracing second chances, even in the most surprising of places.","category":"performing-arts","start":"2024-05-11T02:00:00Z","geo":{"geometry":{"coordinates":[174.7798564,-41.2933108],"type":"Point"},"placekey":"@n7q-mht-435","address":{"country_code":"NZ","formatted_address":"87/77 Courtenay Place, Te Aro, Wellington 6011, New Zealand","postcode":"6011","locality":"Wellington","region":"Wellington"}},"labels":["comedy","entertainment","performing-arts"],"duration":0,"start_local":"2024-05-11T14:00:00","end":"2024-05-11T02:00:00Z","end_local":"2024-05-11T14:00:00","updated":"2024-06-12T06:11:40Z"},{"title":"World of Activation Expo Auckland","description":"Sourced from predicthq.com - Step into a world of wellness and opportunity at the LifeVantage \"World of Activation\" Mother's Day Expo!","category":"expos","start":"2024-05-11T02:00:00Z","geo":{"geometry":{"coordinates":[174.8242851,-36.8441473],"type":"Point"},"placekey":"@n84-d38-b8v","address":{"country_code":"NZ","formatted_address":"Tamaki Drive, Auckland 1071, New Zealand","locality":"Auckland","postcode":"1071","region":"Auckland"}},"labels":["expo","health"],"duration":5400,"start_local":"2024-05-11T14:00:00","end":"2024-05-11T03:30:00Z","end_local":"2024-05-11T15:30:00","updated":"2024-06-05T00:52:32Z"},{"title":"Swan Lake","description":"Sourced from predicthq.com - All Tickets are Mobile Ticket Only.

It consists of a massive opening statement, a shocking blast of demonic fast music, and then a slow movement which is a timeless meditation on eternity. Yet this titanic structure somehow does not have the feel of a fragment; it is entire in itself. This sublime music is perfectly twinned with J.S. Bach, a composer touched by the divine but also a composer of ineffable humanity. The lithe French pianist David Fray, a Bach authority, unveils music that's the perfect blend of the playful and the profound.

Our 2024 season opens with the DSO debut of renowned Swiss conductor Matthias Bamert, directing a programme of music by three of Germany's greatest composers: Beethoven, Brahms and Richard Strauss. Setting the tone will be Beethoven's dramatic and joyous 'Prometheus' Overture. Richard Strauss was a great champion of the French Horn, and his first Horn Concerto remains a staple of the modern horn repertoire. All the technical skills of our soloist, NZSO Principal Horn Samuel Jacobs, will be showcased in what is considered one of the most technically demanding of all French Horn Concertos. Brahms's Third Symphony is said to be his most lyrical and best-crafted symphony - it is also the shortest. Such was its popularity in Brahms day that he thought it 'unfortunately over-famous'!
