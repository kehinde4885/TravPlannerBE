Voters will decide whether to accept an eighth constitutional amendment, previously passed by Parliament in December of 2023. The amendment would add articles 17A and 17B to the constitution, requiring members of Parliament to retain their political party affiliations throughout their term or be dismissed from Parliament. Members of Parliament who ran for election as a party member would have to retain that party affiliation, while members who ran as independent candidates or were elected as the sole representative of their party would have to declare an affiliation with a party represented in Parliament by multiple members within 3 months of the election. \n\n\nGovernment Structure:  \n\n\n\n\nChief of State: President Nikenike VUROBARAVU (since 23 July 2022) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHead of Government: Prime Minister Charlot SALWAI (since 6 October 2023) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly: unicameral Parliament (Palamen) with 52 seats \n\n\n\n\nElectoral System:  \n\n\n\n\nThe President is indirectly elected by members of Parliament and provincial presidents.
