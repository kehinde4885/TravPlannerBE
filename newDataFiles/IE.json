Are you a fan of Chuck Berry, Ray Charles, Elvis, Little Richard, The Beatles, The Stones, The Doors or Jerry Lee Lewis? Then you’ll certainly have heard Full Circle!\n\nOnce known as The Greenbeats, the four-piece group became a household name in the 1960s thanks to a phenomenally successful run of TV appearances. Fast forward to 1978 and out of The Greenbeats Full Circle was born.\n\nIntended to be a brief blast from the past, Full Circle drew huge crowds to their first venue, Toners pub on Baggot Street. The word spread quickly, and Full Circle found themselves, unexpectedly, in huge demand in many of the fast-growing number of new music venues springing up nationwide. \n\nStill playing today the band hasn’t stood still, continually adding to their already huge list of classic rock’ n’ roll numbers. If you are a lifelong fan of this music, or you’ve lately discovered just how good it is, then don’t miss a Full Circle gig. \n\nFull Circle are John Keogh on keyboards, Bernard Barrett on guitar, Brian Rickaby on drum and Brian Harris on bass.","category":"performing-arts","start":"2024-09-01T15:00:00Z","geo":{"geometry":{"coordinates":[-6.2587796,53.3419775],"type":"Point"},"placekey":"@4dp-5qm-z2k","address":{"country_code":"IE","formatted_address":"9 Duke St, Dublin, D02 NR76, Ireland","postcode":"D02 NR76","locality":"Dublin","region":"County Dublin"}},"labels":["entertainment","movie","performing-arts"],"duration":10800,"start_local":"2024-09-01T16:00:00","end":"2024-09-01T18:00:00Z","end_local":"2024-09-01T19:00:00","updated":"2024-06-27T14:33:59Z"},{"title":"Wicked (Touring)","description":"Sourced from predicthq.com - Experience the spellbinding tale of two unlikely friends, Elphaba and Glinda, as they navigate their extraordinary journey through the Land of Oz in the hit Broadway musical, Wicked.
