At Stake in this Election: \n\n\n\n\nAll seats (120-123) in the North Macedonian Assembly \n\n\n\n\nGovernment Structure:  \n\n\n\n\nChief of State: President Stevo PENDAROVSKI (since 12 May 2019) \n\n\nHead of Government: Caretaker Prime Minister Talat XHAFERI (since 28 January 2024) \n\n\nAssembly: unicameral Assembly (Собрание) with 120 seats \n\n\n\n\nElectoral System:  \n\n\n\n\nThe President is directly elected in up to two rounds of voting. To be elected in the first round, a candidate must win an absolute majority of votes from all registered voters. To be elected in the second round, a candidate must win an absolute majority and voter turnout must be at least 40%, otherwise the result is deemed invalid. The President may serve up to two 5-year terms. \n\n\nIn the Assembly, 120 members are directly elected via closed-list proportional representation vote from six constituencies. An additional 3 members may be elected from a single overseas constituency via proportional representation vote so long as the winning list receives at least as many votes as the MP elected with the fewest number of votes in the prior assembly election. All members serve renewable 5-year terms. \n\n\n\n\nLast Election: \n\n\nIn the 2020 Assembly election, the We Can Coalition won the largest share of seats (46) followed by the Renewal Coalition (44) and four additional parties and coalitions who also won seats. Voter turnout was 52.02%. \n\n\nInformation for Voters: \n\n\nInstructions / Упатства / Udhëzime (in Macedonian and Albanian) \n\n\nNew/Unique in this Election:  \n\n\nParliament approved a variety of updates to North Macedonia’s electoral code on March 7. One of the new provisions allows North Macedonians to vote with documents that expired up to 9 months ahead of elections, meaning that many can use passports and driver’s licenses containing the country’s old name, the Republic of Macedonia, as a valid ID. This change is a direct response to many voters’ inability to apply for and receive new documents with the name “Republic of North Macedonia” before their IDs with the old name expired on February 12 after the government was overwhelmed by requests. Without this change in policy, it is estimated that 100,000 North Macedonians would have been unable to vote. Amendments specific to parliament were also made based on recommendations from the ODIHR, including one which stipulates that independent parliamentary lists will need to gain signatures for no less than one percent of the total number of registered voters in the constituency where they are running, a change from the 1,000-signature quota that applied to all electoral districts. \n\n\n\n\nKey Deadlines: \n\n\n\n\nCandidate filing deadline: 2 April 2024 for National Assembly \n\n\nVoter registration deadline: Voter registration is passive for in-country voters.  For overseas voters, the registration deadline was 18 March 2024. \n\n\n\n\nMain Parties in this Election: \n\n\n\n\nFor a European Future Coalition / КОАЛИЦИЈА ЗА ЕВРОПСКА ИДНИНА \n\n\nYour Macedonia Coalition / Коалиција “ТВОЈА МАКЕДОНИЈА“ ВМРО-ДПМНЕ \n\n\nBrave for Macedonia Coalition / Коалиција ХРАБРО ЗА МАКЕДОНИЈА \n\n\nEuropean Front Coalition / Коалиција “ЕВРОПСКИ ФРОНТ’’ \n\n\nLeft / ЛЕВИЦА \n\n\nVlen Coalition / КОАЛИЦИЈА ВЛЕН\n\n\n\n\nPopulation and Registered Voters: \n\n\n\n\nPopulation: 2,057,680 (2022 est.) \n\n\nRegistered Voters: 1,814,317 (2024) \n\n\n\n\nGender Data: \n\n\n\n\nFemale Population: 1,032,060 (2022 est.) \n\n\nCEDAW Status: Ratified (by succession) 18 January 1994 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGender Quota:  At least 40% of candidate slots on each party list must be occupied by members of the less represented gender.
