//Pug Layout Template is Next

API KEYS TO ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES - done

ERRor Handling with ASync Handler
Implement No flights found Page

For the Cummulative Layout Shift , i think its mostly images, cos they are rendered after the first Paint, Specifying the size
of the image through flexbasis or other means fixes the issue

IMPORTANT..
Sometimes API gives Error of Too Many Requests, and messes uo the data to be rendered, I dont know how to fix
- Perhaps  a way to batch the request, or delay the Request using setTimeout
